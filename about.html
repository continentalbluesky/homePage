        <h2>About Kevin Cervantes</h2>
        <p>
          I'm known for their ability to inspire others, take risks, and turn their ideas into successful ventures when it comes to programming. It all started in 2017 in my senior year of high school, my teacher told me that with code you can change the world and peoples life forever. I also want to say thanks to my friend who showed me how to program first in HTML. The information he was giving me was about how computer work because I wanted to be a YouTuber at the time but it turn me into a computer nerd haha. I hope to one day create something that can change the word.
