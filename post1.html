      <p>Didn't get to do much on the site, but right now I have been think about converting my pc into a linux
      pc. Right now I'm running a Window 11 24H2, I think, I might run a Debian base system. Been doing research
      on how to properly secure debian after install and after install. After doing some research I need to add a BIOS
      password and disable secure boot. I will be using Debian version 12.11.0.</p>

      <p> Good afternoon everyone, today I had a interview and I don't think I did very well, but
      what can I say you live and you learn. So today is day one with a debian distro computer, and
      I'm still getting it ready and secure to use I installed the firewall ufw and now I'm installing
      clamav anti-virus application which is new to me but I can't lie the company Logo looks awesome.
       after that i'm going to learn how to encrypt my hard drive or at least some of my files because
      I should have encrypt them when installing debian on my computer lesson learned on that one, looking
      into a company called LUKS abd ecryptfs for directory stuff down the line. if nothing is working I 
      will re do everything before I keep going.</p>
